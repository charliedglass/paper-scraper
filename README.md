# paper-scraper

Paper scraper scrapes headlines, links, and summaries from the <a href = "nytimes.com">New York Times</a> website. By clicking on any of the scrape buttons, you can get new stories from the NYTimes website, which will get saved to a `mongoose` database.

You can also save headlines and articles for later, and comment on those saved articles. Saved articles and comments are also saved in a `mongoose` database.
